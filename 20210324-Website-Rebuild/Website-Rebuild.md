Techbits.io has had a few iterations over the years, and as a bit of a COVID project, I started rebuilding the whole thing from scratch.

It is still a bit of a work in progress, but now *mostly* ready.

I plan to go into detail regarding some of the (in my opinion) cooler bits of the architecture, as well as gradually adding in some old-but-relevant posts from the before-times.
