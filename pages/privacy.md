# Privacy
This site was built with privacy one of the most important considerations.

- No cookies are used on this website.
- Anonymous analytics information will be collected (when I get round to it...), but no identifiable information will be retained or transmitted to any third party.
- Comments are handled using GitHub issues. To leave a comment, you must have a GitHub account, and by extension, accept their terms/privacy policy. You can edit and delete your own comments.
